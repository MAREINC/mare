				<p class="card-details__paragraph">We invite you to get to know some of the dynamic children and teens who are waiting
					for adoption in Massachusetts! All of the children profiled below are in the custody of the Massachusetts Department
					of Children and Families and need a permanent adoptive home. Siblings profiled together are in need of a family who
					can provide them a home together. Please consider these profiles merely an introduction to the child. We respect the
					privacy of children and do not list most medical or mental health issues, nor are we able to capture the full
					strengths and personality of the child. You can learn more about a specific child or sibling group, or get
					information on starting the process of adopting from foster care, by submitting the Request for Information Form
					which is found under each child profile. You can expect to hear back from a MARE staff person about first steps if
					you are new to the process, or with additional child-specific information if you are already licensed.</p>

				<p class="card-details__paragraph">The profiles below are limited to those children or sibling groups for whom the
					parental rights of their biological parents has been terminated by the courts. If you are a Massachusetts family
					with a current, approved homestudy for foster care adoption, you can submit your homestudy for verification with
					MARE. This will allow you access to also view children with a goal of adoption but for whom the courts have yet to
					the terminate parental rights of their biological family. To submit your homestudy for verification, contact <a href="mailto:lizj@mareinc.org">Liz Joyal</a>.
					Families from other New England states and New York can also submit their homestudy.</p>

				<p class="card-details__paragraph">In order to ensure timely responses, we request that you inquire about no more than 8-10 
					children or sibling groups at a time. We do our best to respond within 2-3 business days.</p>
